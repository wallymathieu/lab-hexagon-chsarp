# lab-hexagon-chsarp

This is a starter project based on [fabricioepa/lab-hexagon-java](https://github.com/fabricioepa/lab-hexagon-java). Loosely translated to c# and asp.net core:

* ~~Java~~ C# 
* ~~Spring Framework~~ asp.net core
* ~~Maven multi-module structure~~ Multiple csproj projects

Inspired by the patterns:

* Hexagonal Architecture
* CQRS
* Domain event

The Hexagonal pattern is described by Alistair Cockburn in his blog:

*â€œAllow an application to equally be driven by users, programs, automated test or batch scripts, and to be developed and tested in isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases"* 

You can find o better information about the design of this solution in the presentation [Hexagonal Architecture ](http://fabricioepa.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/hexagonal-architecture)

I should remeber you these patterns are not exclusively related to the ~~Java~~ C# technologies and frameworks.
